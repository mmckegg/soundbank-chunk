soundbank-chunk
===

A group of triggerable [sound descriptors](https://github.com/mmckegg/audio-slot) to be positioned on a [loop-grid](https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-grid) and played with [soundbank](https://github.com/mmckegg/soundbank).

Implements [observ](https://github.com/raynos/observ) for easy data-binding to your views.

## Work in progress

Just an untested code/idea spew at the moment.
